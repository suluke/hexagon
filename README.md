# Hexagon
This is re-implementation of one of my favorite games, [*"Super Hexagon"*](http://distractionware.com/blog/2012/09/super-hexagon/) by Terry Cavanagh ([@terrycavanagh](https://twitter.com/terrycavanagh)).
The project currently only has the working title *Hexagon*.
It is implemented in ECMAScript (ES6) on top of the webgl apis.

## Current State of the Project
The following lists describe what is already working and what is still on the roadmap:

### Done
